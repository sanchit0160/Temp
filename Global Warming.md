### Global Warming

**Introduction:**

Global warming has reached a critical point, with atmospheric CO2 concentrations exceeding 400 parts per million. This significant increase is driving widespread changes in climate patterns and environmental conditions.

**Impacts:**

**Developed Countries:**

- **Heat Waves and Forest Fires:** Many developed nations, particularly in Europe, are experiencing severe heatwaves and devastating forest fires. For example, several European countries have faced intense fires that have threatened communities and ecosystems.
  
- **Hydroelectric Power Dependence:** Countries reliant on hydroelectric power are facing energy crises due to reduced water levels in rivers. For instance, extended periods of drought have led to decreased water flow, impacting the production of hydroelectric energy.

**Developing Countries:**

- **Urban Flooding:** Increasing concretization and urbanization have exacerbated flood risks. In many developing countries, the frequency and severity of urban floods have increased due to inadequate drainage systems.
  
- **Disaster-Related Displacement:** The frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters are causing increased displacement of populations. Small island nations and developing countries, such as Jakarta, are experiencing severe impacts, including sinking or extreme flooding.

- **Double Burden:** Developing nations face the dual challenge of both mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects, often with limited resources.

**Biodiversity:**

- **Zoonotic Diseases:** Melting glaciers and thawing permafrost are releasing ancient bacteria and viruses, increasing the risk of zoonotic diseases.
  
- **Tropicalization of Polar Areas:** Species typically found in tropical regions are moving toward higher latitudes as polar regions warm. This shift affects ecosystems and biodiversity.
  
- **Migratory Patterns:** Changes in climate are altering the migratory patterns of various species, affecting their survival and reproduction.
  
- **Forest Fires and Wildlife Conflicts:** Increased forest fires lead to habitat loss and more frequent human-wildlife conflicts. As forests vanish, endangered species face greater threats of extinction.

**Ecosystems:**

- **Oceans:** Ocean acidification, rising sea levels, and coral reef bleaching are significant concerns. Coral reefs, which are as vital as tropical rainforests, are suffering from increased temperatures and acidification. Tropical cyclones, such as Cyclone Fani, are becoming more intense and frequent.

- **Land Degradation:** Soil erosion is worsening due to frequent rains and floods, while increased evapotranspiration is depleting soil moisture. The loss of green spaces contributes to wind erosion.

- **Mountains:** Glacial melting and ice cap reduction are leading to increased landslides and other hazards in mountainous regions.

**Steps Taken:**

- **UNFCCC:** The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) holds annual Conferences of the Parties (COP) to address climate change issues. The Paris Agreement, established during COP21, aims to limit global warming and enhance climate resilience.
  
- **India's Initiatives:** India's "Panch Pran" (Five Promises) outlines a strategy to address climate change through a variety of measures, including reducing carbon intensity and promoting sustainable development.

- **Local Solutions:** Initiatives such as Peeplantry village, where every girl born leads to a tree being planted, and "Harit Pranam" (Green Greetings) encourage local environmental stewardship and reforestation.

- **LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment):** The LiFE initiative promotes sustainable living and environmental conservation as a way of life.

- **Hydrogen Pledge:** Nations are committing to advancing hydrogen as a clean energy source to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

- **Loss and Damage Fund:** Established under COP27, this fund aims to support developing countries in managing the impacts of climate change, with developed countries covering the costs of adaptation and recovery.
