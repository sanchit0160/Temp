#### Causes

   - Lack of emphasis on Indian ethics and traditional teachings such as those found in the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

2. **Family Structure**:

3. **Influences**:
   - **Cultural Trends**: Influence from popular media and social normalization of drug use, such as seen in movies and college culture.
   - **International Influence**: The proximity to regions like the Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran) and the Golden Triangle (Myanmar, Laos, Thailand) where drug production and trade are significant. Notably, cannabis is legal for medical purposes in Thailand.
   - **Endorsements**: Celebrity endorsements and advertisements can glamorize drug use, influencing public perception.

4. **Enforcement Challenges**:
   - The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is criticized for its focus on low-level drug peddlers rather than disrupting the supply chain at higher levels.
